# ROS2_CPP_KalmanFilter

This ROS2 package implements a CPP based Kalman Filter which subscribes the IMU data from "/imu/data" ros topic and publishes it to "/filtered/imu" rostopic.

This package was built to learn and understand Modern C++ based package creation. This is a self-learning project.

The data utilized for this implementation was taken from different online sources.
